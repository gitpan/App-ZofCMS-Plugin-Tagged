App-ZofCMS-Plugin-Tagged

App::ZofCMS::Plugin::Tagged - ZofCMS plugin to fill templates with data from
query, template variables and configuration using <TAGS>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Your ZofCMS template:

    {
        cookie_foo  => '<TAG:TNo cookies:{d}{cookies}{foo}>',
        query_foo   => '[<TAG:Q:{foo}>]',
        set_cookies => [ ['foo', 'bar' ]],
        plugins     => [ { Cookies => 10 }, { Tagged => 20 } ],
        conf => {
            base => 'test.tmpl',
        },
    }

In your 'test.tmpl' base L<HTML::Template> template:

    Cookie 'foo' is set to: <tmpl_var name="cookie_foo"><br>
    Query 'foo' is set to: <tmpl_var name="query_foo">

In ZofCMS template the Cookies plugin is set to run before Tagged plugin,
thus on first page access cookies will not be set, and we will access
the page without setting the 'foo' query parameter. What do we see:

    Cookie 'foo' is set to: No cookies
    Query 'foo' is set to: []

No, if we run the page the second time it (now cookies are set with
L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::Cookies> plugin) will look like this:

    Cookie 'foo' is set to: bar
    Query 'foo' is set to: []

If we pass query parameter 'foo' to the page, setting it to 'beer'
our page will look like this:

    Cookie 'foo' is set to: bar
    Query 'foo' is set to: [beer]

That's the power of Tagged plugin... now I'll explain what those weird
looking tags mean.
